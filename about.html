      <p class="lead">
        At the heart of my work is systems thinking: I explore how social, technological, and institutional forces interact to shape wicked problems in health and education, and design interventions with curiosity, empathy, and structural awareness.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        My projects span tobacco policy in South Asia to AI in cancer detection to equitable music education. At their core: helping people navigate complexity with more clarity, connection, and dignity.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I bring systems thinking, cultural literacy, and strategic creativity to solve problems that donâ€™t fit in one discipline.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I love thinking upstream and challenging the frames of existing worldviews. I'm currently on a mission to be authentic, seek discomfort, and stay a lifelong learner.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In my free time, you can find me lifting weights, producing or performing music, or drawing.
