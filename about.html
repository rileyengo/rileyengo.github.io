        At the heart of my work is systems thinking: I explore how social, technological, and institutional forces interact to shape wicked problems in health and education, and design interventions with curiosity, empathy, and structural awareness.

        My projects span tobacco policy in South Asia to AI in cancer detection to equitable music education. At their core: helping people navigate complexity with more clarity, connection, and dignity.

        I bring systems thinking, cultural literacy, and strategic creativity to solve problems that donâ€™t fit in one discipline.

        I love thinking upstream and challenging the frames of existing worldviews. I'm currently on a mission to be authentic, seek discomfort, and stay a lifelong learner.
        This site is evolving, just like me. If anything here stands out to you, let's chat. I'm always excited to connect and learn from others.
