        <strong>I thrive in the space between disciplines.</strong> Where medicine meets music, where policy meets personal stories, and where stories expand into systemic change. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="lead">
        I explore how social, technological, and institutional forces interact to shape wicked problems in health and education, and design interventions with curiosity, empathy, and structural awareness.
      </p>
      
      <p class="lead">
        Music is where I first fell in love with storytellingâ€”a performance or lesson can deeply shape how someone feels, thinks, and remembers. This same drive to connect meaningfully with people runs through all of my work in research, design, and building new experiences.
      </p>
      
      <p class="lead">
        Shaped by growing up between cultures, my systems lens means I'm drawn to thinking upstream and work that lives in the in-betweenâ€”between disciplines, perspectives, and people. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="lead">
        From tobacco policy in South Asia to AI in cancer detection to equitable music education, I bring systems thinking, cultural literacy, and strategic creativity to solve problems that donâ€™t fit in one box.
      </p>

      <p class="lead">
        In my free time, you can find me lifting weights, producing or performing music, or drawing.
      </p>
      
      <p class="lead">
        This site is evolving, just like me. If anything here stands out to you, let's chat. I'm always excited to connect and learn from others.
