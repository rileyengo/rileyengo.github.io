        <strong>Key to my life is a love for connectionâ€”between ideas, people, and places.</strong><br />From music to health, Iâ€™m drawn to the spaces in between, where new stories can shine through. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="lead">
        Music is where I first fell in love with storytellingâ€”a performance or lesson can deeply shape how someone feels, thinks, and remembers. This same drive to connect meaningfully with people runs through all of my work in research, design, and building new experiences.
      </p>
      
      <p class="lead">
        Growing up between cultures taught me to live in the in-betweenâ€”between perspectives and people. I gravitate toward upstream questions and approaches that bridge disciplines, people, and ideas.
      </p>
      
      <p class="lead">
        From tobacco policy in South Asia to AI in cancer detection to equitable music education, my work applies systems thinking, cultural literacy, and creative strategy to problems that donâ€™t fit in one box.
      </p>

      <p class="lead">
        In my free time, you can find me lifting weights, producing or performing music, or drawing.
      </p>

        This site is evolving, just like me. If anything here stands out to you, let's chat. I'm always excited to connect and learn from others.
